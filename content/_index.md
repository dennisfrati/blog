Welcome to my **blog**:).  
I am an aspiring **DevOps Engineer** with a deep passion for the **GNU/Linux** ecosystem and the world of **Technology**.

### My story:
My journey into the world of **computer science** began about 5 years ago.  
One day, by chance, I stumbled upon a video about how to program a simple game in Python, and from that moment it was love at first sight for this world.  
I may not be the most skilled **programmer** or **sysadmin** you'll meet, but I'm certainly passionate about this world.  
I truly love the world of open source and GNU/Linux, I'm a huge fan of bash scripting, and my biggest dream is to enter this world and make a contribution, even if small, to this amazing community.

### What you will find here:

- **GNU/Linux Commands Guides:** Tips and tricks for terminal power users. [`commands`]
